<h1>AStar2D Simulation</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
  This is a 2D simulation of the Astar algorithm, a small part of a larger project I've been working on. In this project the agent will find the shortest 
  path from its position to the Node2D labeled goal. This agents path updates in real time changing its path if the goal node changes position.
